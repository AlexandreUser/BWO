### On the Table
The world isn't stored in anywhere, it uses some conecpts and rules to generate it equaly in all devices only the changes made by player are actually stored on the firebase.

The players will be able to build theirs houses anywhere on the infinity world. That's why i call it borderless world in first place. :)

This project is still in development and right now it only has some fews features:

- A map generator for a real infinity Map with a mix of `Perlin Noise` and `Simplex Noise` without losing the performance.
- Trees generation
- Map Viewport and Map Follow Object Moviment
- Temporaraly Saving generated data for best perfomance

## Dev Log

Right now i'm focusing on the performance improviments in order to bring it the best fps as i can.[done]
Next steps will be the player design it self and collision detection with the enviroment.[done]

Next step will be making the player swim, or at least looks like it is floating on the water.
